            <h2>Welcome to Logan's Home Renovation</h2>
            <p>This business was designed to bring the best renovations to home owners in the East Tennessee Area. Our goal is to give you our best efforts in renovating your house while doing it quickly and cheaply. We are known for our sheetrocking, flooring, and cabinetry installation. Our business will beat any of our competitors quotes because we can get the job done in a much better time frame. You would not even know we were there. However, we are not professionals and there are no refunds for any mistakes. The customer must supply us with the materials to work with and any problems in the way of our work will be an upcharge to the customer. We also do not claim liability for any damages.</p>

            <p>We also offer to demo anything you would like. Our goal is to demo every room we work in to the studs. We like to start fresh on a project and what better way than starting from the studs with new everything. When we demo we charge hourly and if we have any problems that will be an upcharge. An example would be if there is screws in the studs it will cost extra to pull them out. We do not use power tools on our projects, so it makes it take more time for us to get the room completly stripped. Also a reminder that if any major damages comes from a demo we are no liable for anything.</p>
