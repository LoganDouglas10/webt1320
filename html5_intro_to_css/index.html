        <h2>March Madness Info</h2>
        <p>The March Madness tournament consist of 64 college basketball teams who qualify for seeding in the tournament. This tournament is played throughout most of March and the first week of April. Teams have to go through a grueling stretch of games between 64 of the best team in the nation. The name fits the tournament well because it really is madness. Teams you would expect to win will loss to a team you thought did not have a chance to make it out the first round. This tournament comes down to more than skill whenever the teams are playing. The teams with the most hurt and momentum have the best chance of success. It is survive and win or go home defeated with nothing to show from the season.</p>

        <h3>The Final 4 Bracket</h3>
        <p>The final 4 of the tournament are the last teams playing after 4 tournament rounds. These teams have proved they have what it takes to be the best team in the nation. The first matchup is #5 San Diego St vs. #9 FAU. San Diego St beat Alabama which was one of the best teams in the nation at the time. Fau had to play 4 strong teams in a row, and they beat each one convincingly enough to prove they are a top team. I have FAU beating San Diego St simply because they have the best momentum at the moment. The other matchup is #5 Miami vs. #4 UConn. Miami has knocked off #1 Houston and #2 Texas in back to back rounds, butmUConn has beat every team they have played by 10+ points to get to the Final 4. I have Miami beating UConn in a thriller based of how well they can shoot the 3 ball in clutch situations. Based off of my predictions, it will be #9 FAU vs. #5 Miami in the  national championship.</p>
