    <h2>A Little Info Into Our Life</h2>
    <p>In the picture above is my lovely girlfriend Kali. We are currently living with her mom while we are remoding our house. We completly stripped it to the studs and currently putting up the drywall. Hopefully we will be in it when fall comes around. We love to go to Tennessee games together as you can see from the picture. That picture was the first game we ever went to together. We travlled down to Louisiana this year to watch Tennessee play LSU. Then went to Fort Walton Beach for a week right after we left the stadium. Then got back home just in time that same week to go watch Tennessee beat Alabama. There was not a better way that trip could have ended. A month after this game is whenever we got to start tearing the inside of our new house apart. We are currently saving every penny we can for this place while I am also saving for a ring to propose sometime next fall. Hopefully, everything we are working for right now will pay off come fall time.</p>
