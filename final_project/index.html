            <h2>Tennessee Football's Memorable 2022 Season</h2>
            <p>Tennessee Football had a very memorable season in 2022. Looking back at the 2021 season, the way it ended was with a heartbreaking overtime loss to Purdue. It was literal heartbreak as people were watching it live seeing Tennessee have the game possibly stolen by a very controversial forward progress call. Without this call, Tennessee would have scored a touchdown to put the pressure on Purdue. That did not happen. They lost to a field goal in overtime. Looking back on that, that sparked the momentum for 1st year head coach, Josh Heupel, going into his 2nd season. After everything he accomplished in his first season at Tennessee, it was time for more in 2022.</p>

            <p>Going into 2022, people knew that Josh Heupel had one of the best offensive minds in college football. The question was if he could finish games in 2022, unlike in 2021 where he lost a few late in the 4th quarter. Well needless to say, he proved he could finish games. He pulled off an amazing 11-2 season, beating 6 ranked teams, in his 2nd year as Tennessee's Head Coach. He also got Tennessee to their first number one ranking since 1998, and his offense ranked as the number one offense in the nation led by Hendon Hooker and Jalin Hyatt. Hooker was Heupel's main guy at QB, but unfortunately, he went down with an ACL tear late in the season at South Carolina. Hyatt went on to win the Biletnikoff award for most outstanding receiver during the college football season. This team fell just short of the college football playoff. However, this was one of the best Tennessee teams in 2 decades and made many memorable moments for lifelong Tennessee fans. Let's take a look at 3 key Tennessee games this season that fans will never forget.</p>
